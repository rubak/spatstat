\description{
  An object describing the Saturated Pairwise Interaction
  family of point process models
}
\details{
  \bold{Advanced Use Only!}
  
  This structure would not normally be touched by
  the user. It describes the ``saturated pairwise interaction''
  family of point process models.
 
  If you need to create a specific interaction model for use in 
  spatial pattern analysis, use the function \code{\link{Saturated}()}
  or the two existing implementations of models in this family,
  \code{\link{Geyer}()} and \code{\link{SatPiece}()}.
 
  Geyer (1999) introduced the ``saturation process'', a modification of the
  Strauss process in which the total contribution
  to the potential  from each point (from its pairwise interaction with all 
  other points) is trimmed to a maximum value \eqn{c}. 
  This model is implemented in the function \code{\link{Geyer}()}.
 
  The present class \code{pairsat.family} is the 
  extension of this saturation idea to all pairwise interactions.
  Note that the resulting models are no longer pairwise interaction
  processes - they have interactions of infinite order.
 
  \code{pairsat.family} is an object of class \code{"isf"} 
  containing a function \code{pairwise$eval} for
  evaluating the sufficient statistics of any saturated pairwise interaction
  point process model in which the original pair potentials 
  take an exponential family form.
