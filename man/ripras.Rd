\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    vector of \code{x} coordinates of observed points,

    or a list with components \code{x,y} giving coordinates
    (such as a point pattern object of class \code{"ppp"}.)
  }
  \item{y}{(optional) vector of \code{y} coordinates of observed points,
    if \code{x} is a vector.}

\value{
  A window (an object of class \code{"owin"}).

\details{
  Given an observed pattern of points with coordinates 
  given by \code{x} and \code{y}, this function computes 
  an estimate due to Ripley and Rasson (1977) of the
  spatial domain from which the points came. 

  The points are
  assumed to have been generated independently and uniformly
  distributed inside an unknown domain \eqn{D}.

  If \code{shape="convex"} (the default), the domain \eqn{D} is assumed
  to be a convex set. The maximum
  likelihood estimate of \eqn{D} is the convex hull of the 
  points (computed by \code{\link{convexhull.xy}}).
  Analogously to the problems of estimating the endpoint
  of a uniform distribution, the MLE is not optimal.
  Ripley and Rasson's estimator is a rescaled copy of the convex hull,
  centred at the centroid of the convex hull.
  The scaling factor is 
  \eqn{1/sqrt(1 - m/n)}{1/\sqrt{1 - \frac m n}}
  where \eqn{n} is the number of data points and 
  \eqn{m} the number of vertices of the convex hull.
  The scaling factor may be overridden using the argument \code{f}.

  If \code{shape="rectangle"}, the domain \eqn{D} is assumed
  to be a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The maximum
  likelihood estimate of \eqn{D} is the bounding box of the points
  (computed by \code{\link{bounding.box.xy}}). The Ripley-Rasson
  estimator is a rescaled copy of the bounding box,
  with scaling factor \eqn{(n+1)/(n-1)}
  where \eqn{n} is the number of data points,
  centred at the centroid of the bounding box.
  The scaling factor may be overridden using the argument \code{f}.
